# Simple Loan Portfolio Analysis (Python)

This project uses a simplified loan dataset to explore basic portfolio-level metrics such as total exposure, weighted average margin, exposure by credit rating, and simple loss sensitivity.

The objective is to reinforce credit portfolio concepts using basic Python (pandas, numpy), rather than to build a production-level financial model.
